## Training day 1

This subdirectory contains different code examples we'll cover in class today. It should serve as reference if you'd like to consult it during and after the training program

## Suggested Exercises

Below are some quick exercises to help you further your understanding of computer vision workflows.

1. Starting from the `camera_opencv.py` script, how can you adapt the programming structure to display a video recording instead of the webcam feed?

    * What if you want to show a static image instead?

2.  Starting from the `yolo_testing.py` script, is there a way for you to run the inference model on a video instead of the webcam feed? Test it out.

3. Starting from the `yolo_testing.py` script, can you explore different models that are available on the ultralytics platform
