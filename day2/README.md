## Training day 2

The objectives for the day are the following: 

* Integrating the basic ingredients of ai models for computer vision in an interactive system. 

* Testing a demo of an interactive system using the `interactive_demo.score` script.

* Learning about python functions

* Using python functions to create your own interactive workflows


## Suggested Exercises

Below are some exercises so you can understand better the interactive systems we're building

1. Based on `mediapipe_full.py`, how would you go about writing a python script for the different detection options using the mediapipe system (hands detection and face mesh). (Hint: look at the helpful references section!)

2.  Based on the interactive demo system we have covered in class, what happens if you change the inputs going into the ISF shader that controls the visual output?

3. Based on `interaction_testing`, how would you go about writing different functions to generate various data analysis? Here are some examples: 

    * How can you get the distance between two hands?

    * How can you create an on/off switch based on the position of one keypoint in the image

    * Can you create different output messages based on whether you're touching your nose with your hand or your shoulder?
